# Project Name
> Bike Sharing System

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

 consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

## General Information
This Project is about one well-commented Python file briefly mention the insights and observations from the analysis 
Presented the overall approach of the analysis in a presentation,
Also It includes the problem statement and the analysis approach briefly.
Explained the results of EDA, Included visualisations and summarise the important results in the presentation.

Background of your project 
It is required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features

The business probem that your project is trying to solve
The Company aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

The dataset that is being used?
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.
